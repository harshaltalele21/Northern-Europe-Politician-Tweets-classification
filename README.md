Classification of Tweets of Politicians from Northern Europe

This project aims to explore various methods to predict the correct political spectrum based on user tweets from Northern Europe. An accurate classification of political views is extremely im- portant for understanding public opinion and shaping policy decisions.
In order to achieve this objective, we have used a com- prehensive dataset of tweets collected over a specific period of time. This data set includes diverse political ideologies. We utilized exploratory data analysis to better understand the data and political views of the users across various domains. This helped in gaining clarity on the nuances of political discourse on Twitter. Our study also takes into account different natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to process and analyze the textual part of the data i.e. user tweets. It includes sentiment analysis, topic modeling and finally predicting the political orientation of these users.
The methods deployed helped in shedding light on the effectiveness of using Twitter data as a valuable resource for classifying individuals along the political spectrum. Further, the research provides a good benchmark model to predict the political discourse of users that can be used by organizations across the world in order to take data driven decisions and form better strategies
